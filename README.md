**FPS Optimizer for Crashing**

FPS Optimizer for Crashing made in **Lua**

Any questions go in my **Discord DMS** (a cat#0002)
**If there are any bugs, please let me know at my discord**

I get about 500 FPS with this script, i usually get 200 FPS, it really should help low end pc's.

## Specs I use

- GTX 1050 Ti
- Intel I5 7500
- 16 GB ram
That's all really good, combined u can crash in about ~100 seconds on a private server, 30 seconds in a public server if u have a better rig then me


## Requirements
- nothing, just a pretty decent pc, but this script should make it work for mid-ish pc's

## Most importantly
**Have fun and thanks for using my script!**
